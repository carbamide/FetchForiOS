/**
* ICTextView.h
* ------------
* https://github.com/Exile90/ICTextView.git
*
*
* Version:
* --------
* 1.0.1
*
*
* Authors:
* --------
* - Ivano Bilenchi (@SoftHardW)
*
*
* Description:
* ------------
* ICTextView is a UITextView subclass with optimized support for string/regex search and highlighting.
* It also features some iOS 7 specific improvements and bugfixes to the standard UITextView.
* 
*
* Features:
* ---------
* + Support for string and regex search and highlighting
* * Highly customizable
* * Doesn't use delegate methods (you can still implement your own)
* + Methods to account for contentInsets in iOS 7
* * Contains workarounds to many known iOS 7 UITextView bugs
*
*
* Compatibility:
* --------------
* ICTextView is compatible with iOS 4.x and above. Match highlighting is supported starting from iOS 5.x.
*
* !!!WARNING!!! - contains ARC enabled code. Beware, MRC purists.
*
*
* Configuration:
* --------------
* See comments in the "#pragma mark - Configuration" section.
*
*
* Usage:
* ------
*
*   Search:
*   -------
*   Searches can be performed via the "scrollToMatch:searchOptions:range:" and "scrollToString:searchOptions:range:" methods.
*   If a match is found, ICTextView highlights a primary match, and starts highlighting other matches while the user scrolls.
*
*   "scrollToMatch:" performs regex searches, while "scrollToString:" searches for string literals.
*   Both search methods are regex-powered, and therefore make use of "NSRegularExpressionOptions".
*
*   Searching for the same pattern multiple times will automatically match the next result, you don't need to update the range argument.
*   In fact, you should only specify it if you wish to restrict the search to a specific text range.
*   Search is optimized when the specified range and search pattern do not change (aka repeated searches).
*
*   The "rangeOfFoundString" property contains the range of the current search match.
*   You can get the actual string by calling the "foundString" method.
*
*   The "resetSearch" method lets you restore the search variables to their starting values, effectively resetting the search.
*   Calls to "resetSearch" cause the highlights to be deallocated, regardless of the "maxHighlightedMatches" variable.
*   After this method has been called, ICTextView stops highlighting results until a new search is performed.
*
*
*   Content insets methods:
*   -----------------------
*   The "scrollRangeToVisible:consideringInsets:" and "scrollRectToVisible:animated:consideringInsets:" methods let you scroll
*   until a certain range or rect is visible, eventually accounting for content insets.
*   This was the default behavior for "scrollRangeToVisible:" before iOS 7, but it has changed since (possibly because of a bug).
*   This method calls "scrollRangeToVisible:" in iOS 6.x and below, and has a custom implementation in iOS 7.
*
*   The other methods are pretty much self-explanatory. See the "#pragma mark - Misc" section for further info.
